        <p>The first game/franchise I think is best is the Battlefield franchise. because of the feel of the games, also the destruction elements of the game where you can make an entrance by blowing a hole into the wall, another reason is the graphics.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The second game/franchise I think is the best is the Assassin's Creed franchise. because of the parkour, the graphics, and the feel, also the animations.</p>
